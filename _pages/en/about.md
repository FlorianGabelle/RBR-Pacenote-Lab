## üë§ The author

I'm Florian Gabelle, creator of **RBR Pacenote Lab**.

Double graduate in mechanical automotive engineering and software engineering. I first learned to drive in *Richard Burns Rally* back in 2005‚Äîwell before attending real driving school. That simracing experience sparked a lasting passion for motorsport, both real and digital.

With a background in electronics, software, mechanical engineering, and racing, this project naturally brings together my interests‚Äîwhere creative design meets technical problem-solving.

## üöÄ The project

**RBR Pacenote Lab** has been a space to grow my skills in software development‚Äîfrom UI design to data analysis and deployment. It let me explore the full development cycle hands-on.

One of my goals was to see how far I could go with **Python** as the core technology‚Äîand it exceeded expectations.

This tool was built with genuine passion for the **simracing** and **rally** communities, aiming to offer something practical and enjoyable for fellow enthusiasts.
