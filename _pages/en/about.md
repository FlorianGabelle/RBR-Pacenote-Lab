## 👤 About the author

**Florian Gabelle**  
Creator of **RBR Pacenote Lab**

Mechanical automotive engineer turned software engineer. I first learned to drive in *Richard Burns Rally* back in 2005—well before attending real driving school. That simracing experience sparked a lasting passion for motorsport, both real and digital.

With a background in electronics, software, mechanical engineering, and racing, this project naturally brings together my interests—where creative design meets technical problem-solving.

## 🚀 About the project

**RBR Pacenote Lab** has been a space to grow my skills in software development—from UI design to data analysis and deployment. It let me explore the full development cycle hands-on.

One of my goals was to see how far I could go with **Python** as the core technology—and it exceeded expectations.

This tool was built with genuine passion for the **simracing** and **rally** communities, aiming to offer something practical and enjoyable for fellow enthusiasts.
