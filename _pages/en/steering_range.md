To ensure the in-game steering angle matches your physical wheel rotation, it's important to set the steering range value correctly.

The goal is simple:  
**One degree in-game = one degree on your wheel**

This one-to-one match provides precise, repeatable steering measurements — essential for generating consistent corner pacenotes.

### ⚙️ Configuration

The recommended approach is to set the **steering range in your wheel base software** to match the **car’s steering angle**, as shown in the car selection menu of the game. Use the same value in the analysis settings.

If you're using the **"Adjust steering wheel range per car"** option or the **"Steering wheel lock-to-lock rotation"** setting in the *My Cars* section of the RSF Launcher, you should still base the configuration on your wheel base's range setting.

If you're unsure or want to verify your setup, use the calibration tool included in the application. It helps fine-tune the correct range using live telemetry.

For detailed instructions, see the [Calibration tool](/en/calibration_tool/) page.
