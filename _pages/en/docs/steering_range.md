To ensure the in-game steering angle matches your physical wheel rotation, it's important to set the steering range value correctly.

The goal is simple:  
**One degree in-game = one degree on your wheel**

This one-to-one match provides precise, repeatable steering measurements — essential for generating consistent corner pacenotes.

### ⚙️ Configuration

- If **"Adjust steering wheel range per car"** is enabled in RSF Launcher, use the **car's steering angle value**.
- If you're using **"Steering wheel lock-to-lock rotation"** in the *My Cars* section along with **"Adjust steering wheel range per car"**, use the **custom value you've set to override the NGP default**.
- If **neither setting is enabled**, use your **wheel base’s steering range value**.

If you're unsure or want to verify your setup, use the calibration tool included in the application. It helps fine-tune the correct range using live telemetry.

For detailed instructions, see the [Calibration tool](/en/calibration_tool/) page.
