The detection threshold is a key analysis parameter. It affects several aspects of how the tool interprets your telemetry data:

- Start-of-corner detection  
- End-of-corner detection  
- Corner length calculation  
- Distances between corners (and therefore corner linking)

### ðŸ”½ Lowering the threshold

Reducing the threshold will:

- Allow detection of corners with **smaller** amplitudes (e.g., fast, sweeping turns)
- Result in **longer** measured corner lengths, which may reduce precision

---

### ðŸ”¼ Increasing the threshold

Raising the threshold will:

- Filter out subtle steering changes by **ignoring** low-amplitude inputs
- Improve **separation** between corners, creating clearer individual detections

---

### âœ… Recommended Setting

The default value of **10 degrees** provides a **balanced compromise**, working well with standard corner lengths, link thresholds, and distances.

You can adjust this setting based on your specific needs:

- **Decrease** the value to make detection more sensitive, which helps identify minor or fast corners.

- **Increase** the value slightly if nearby corners are being grouped together and detected as a single corner.

Lowering the detection threshold doesnâ€™t always lead to better results or higher-quality notes. In some cases, a higher threshold can be more effective. Detecting very low-intensity corners may cause issues, such as difficulty distinguishing between consecutive, closely spaced corners.

> ðŸ“Œ Note: Raw steering data is pre-processed â€” itâ€™s down-sampled and filtered to reduce signal noise near the threshold level and to improve performance.
