Once you're satisfied with the generated pacenotes, you can export the file directly from the main interface.

### 📂 File format and compatibility

The exported file is fully compatible with:

- **RBR Pacenote Plugin** — for in-game use  
- **RBR Roadbook** — for review and post-processing

You can use the file as-is, or (recommended) open it in *RBR Roadbook* to add contextual details such as:

- Tightening radius corners  
  *(e.g., a “4 right tightens to 2 right” is currently marked only as a “2 right”)*  
- Obstacles and hazards  
  *(e.g., fords, bridges, don’t cut, rocks, narrow sections)*  
- Stage profile notes  
  *(e.g., over crest, bump, jump, dip, surface changes)*

This final step adds information that can’t be derived from telemetry but improves clarity and accuracy during the run.

### ✅ Final step: select your file in RSF

After generating and editing your pacenotes, make sure to select the correct file in **RSF Launcher** for the stage you completed your recce on.

### 📌 Export requirements

- Always export the file into the correct stage folder.  
  For **BTB stages**, this is especially important — stage tags are added during export and cannot be reassigned later.
