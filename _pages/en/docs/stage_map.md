The **stage map** is the primary tool for evaluating the quality of your pacenote generation settings.

It gives you a clear, accurate visual of the data and how it maps to the stage.

### 🧾 Visual elements

- Pacenote graphics as defined in the editor  
- Pacenote details including link type, amplitude, and length  
- Distance calls and stage tags  
- Pacenote positions (with distance in meters)  
- Corner detections shown as blue segments

### 🖱️ Mouse controls

- **Left-click + drag** — pan the map and hide graphics/labels  
- **Scroll wheel** — zoom in and out  
- **Right-click** — reset to default zoom

> 🔍 The zoom level is preserved between analysis runs.  
> This makes it easy to zoom in on a specific part of the stage and compare results while adjusting different settings.

> 🧩 Tip: Use the stage map regularly to confirm that your detection and configuration settings result in clear, reliable pacenotes — especially across different corner types.
