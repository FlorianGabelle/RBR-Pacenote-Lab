Once you've set up the application and adjusted the configuration to your liking, follow this workflow to create and refine your pacenotes:

1. **Drive the recce**  
   Perform your initial reconnaissance run on the stage.  
   - Drive in the **middle of the road**  
   - Maintain a **slow, steady speed**  
   - Use **smooth steering inputs**, as they define the quality of the data  
   - Avoid loading the front tires — take corners slowly to reduce distortion in corner detection

2. **Record your recce** (optional) using **RBR Roadbook** and **OBS**  
   Capturing the run visually can help with later editing and review.

3. **Import the telemetry file**  
   Load the recorded telemetry into the app for analysis.

4. **Analyze the data**  
   The tool processes your input to detect corners and generate related metrics.

5. *(Optional)* **Adjust analysis settings and re-run**  
   Fine-tune parameters such as detection threshold, corner filtering, or offset.  
   Run the analysis again after each change to evaluate the effect on results.

6. **Export the pacenote file**  
   Save the pacenotes to the correct stage directory.  

7. **Import into RBR Roadbook**  
   Load the file into **RBR Roadbook** for editing.

8. **Drive a second recce** with audio notes  
   Use **RBR Roadbook** to add refinements while recording new observations.

9. **Do a final edit**  
   Review and fine-tune your pacenotes for accuracy and completeness.

10. **Select the file in RSF**  
    Choose your finalized pacenote file in **RSF** for use during the stage.

> ✅ This process combines automated analysis with manual refinement, giving you a robust and personalized pacenote set.
