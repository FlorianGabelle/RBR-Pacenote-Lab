<p>Once the application is installed and configured to your preferences, follow these steps to create and refine your pacenotes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Drive the recce</strong><br>
    Perform your initial reconnaissance run on the stage.
    <ul>
      <li>Drive in the <strong>middle of the road</strong></li>
      <li>Maintain a <strong>slow, steady speed</strong></li>
      <li>Use <strong>smooth steering inputs</strong>, as they define the quality of the data</li>
      <li>Avoid loading the front tires — take corners slowly to reduce distortion in corner detection</li>
    </ul>
    {% include video.html src="/assets/videos/recce.mp4" %}
  </li>
  <br>

  <li>
    <strong>Import the telemetry file and analyze the data</strong><br>
    Load the recorded telemetry into the app for analysis.  
    The tool processes your input to detect corners and generate related metrics.

    {% include video.html src="/assets/videos/import.mp4" %}
  </li>
  <br>

  <li>
    <strong>Export the pacenote file</strong><br>
    Save the pacenotes to the correct stage directory.
    {% include video.html src="/assets/videos/export.mp4" %}
  </li>
  <br>

  <li>
    <strong>(Optional but highly recommended) Refine your notes in RBR Roadbook</strong><br>
    Enhance your notes by adding essential information, such as obstacles, stage profile characteristics, or variable-radius corners (tightens).
    {% include video.html src="/assets/videos/edit.mp4" %}
  </li>
  <br>

  <li>
    <strong>Select the pacenote file in RSF</strong><br>
    Choose your finalized pacenote file in the <strong>RSF Launcher</strong> for use during the stage.
    {% include video.html src="/assets/videos/rsf_my_pacenotes.mp4" %}
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
✅ This process combines automated analysis with manual refinement, giving you a robust and personalized pacenote set.
